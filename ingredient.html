          <h2>What ingredients can you put in a sandwich?</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            As long as you are brave enough, you can put nearly <strong>anything</strong> on a sandwich!<br />
            Whether it be bacon, anchovies, or the almighty <strong>CHEESE SLICE</strong>, anything goes!<br />
            One of my personal favorites is yellow <strong>mustard</strong>, due to its versatility, flavor,<br />
            and characteristic color! Of course, we can't forget the all important <strong>bread</strong>, the most crucial<br />
            medium for our other ingredients to lie between. Some may argue that a <strong>hot dog</strong> is a sandwich,<br />
            but that is clearly nonsense, because it is most certainly a <strong>burrito</strong>. Tune in next week to find<br />
            out once and for all if a soup is in fact a salad!
